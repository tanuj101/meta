# Résumé

{/* Spans `#hobby-percent` and `#job-percent` are filled by JS. */}

I've developed software as a hobbyist for
<span class="border-dashed" id="hobby-percent">almost all</span> of my life, and
for <span class="border-dashed" id="job-percent">a good fraction</span> of that,
it's also been my full-time job. It's a privilege to be able to make a living
doing what I love.

As my résumé could no longer hold all the details that I wanted to have on my profile, I try to maintain this.

If you like what you see here and want to work with me, you can grab the
<Link url={import.meta.env.DEV ? '/resume/pdf' : '/resume.pdf'}>PDF version</Link>
of this résumé. Print responsibly.
