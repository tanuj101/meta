# Colophon

This website is based on <Link url="https://github.com/recivi/recivi" target="_blank">recivi</Link>. My <Link url="https://github.com/tanuj101/recivi" target="_blank">JSON based résumé</Link> is available on GitHub along with <Link url="https://github.com/tanuj101/meta" target="_blank">source code</Link> to use as you like. The web space is registered as a free sub-domain with <a href="https://is-a.dev/" target="_blank">is-a.dev</a> and is hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">https://www.netlify.com/</a>

## Design

### Colors

The site's color palette comes from [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/),
specifically the Mocha and Latte variants for the dark and light modes
respectively.

### Typography

The site uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson, as the
sans-serif typeface. Inter is famously readable at all sizes and weights, for
both headings and body text. The résume, for a more classical look, uses the
serif typeface [Spectral](https://productiontype.com/font/spectral) by
Production Type. Both fonts are open-source and licensed under the SIL Open Font
License 1.1.

The programming typeface is set to `monospace` for a multitude of reasons:
- This respects the font choices of the user. Programmers are very particular
  about their typefaces, and letting them read in their preferred font makes for
  a good experience.
- Not having to download a font makes the site faster and more efficient, and
  avoids the flash of unstyled text.

Unfortunately, users of Safari will probably not have a choice in fonts, so they
will have to exercise their choice in web browsers.

## Technology

For a developer portfolio, I find it ironic that this is a collection of largely
static pages.

- The site is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/recivi/portfolio">originally</a> built on the concept of progressive enhancement and can be used
  without both CSS and JavaScript, with little or no degradation in the overall
  experience.
- The source code is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a>, because
  JS should be strongly typed, HTML should be broken into components and CSS
  should be tokenized.
- Open Graph images (_e.g._ [this one](/og/colophon.png)) are generated with
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/og">`@vercel/og`</a>. Automation is great
  for tasks like this that are otherwise impossible to do manually with
  consistency.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://goatcounter.com">GoatCounter</a> provides privacy-friendly metrics
  without adding too much bloat. Data is only retained for 31 days. You can opt
  out by disabling JavaScript in your browser.
- My [interactive résumé](/resume/) and some other parts of the site generated
  from a JSON file using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/recivi/recivi">Récivi</a>, a personal
  endeavour to create a new kind of résumé for computers.
- The only external requests this site makes are to
  [Rasmus' site](https://rsms.me) for Inter,
  [Goat Counter](https://goatcounter.com) for analytics and.
