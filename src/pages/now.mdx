# Now

These are all the things I am currently involved in spanning a few days in the
past, and the foreseeable future.

## Working

- As a Frontend Engineer on [Almada](https://alm-live.kwalee.com/),
  an [ad mediation solution](https://www.is.com/glossary/ad-mediation/) for
  game studios, ad networks and businesses. It is a [React](https://react.dev/) project
  that allows game developers to integrate their games with Kwalee's SDK to manage & optimize multiple ad networks, fill rates and efficiency all in one place.
- As a founding 

## Building

- [`meta`](https://github.com/tanuj101/meta), an astro based project powering this website.


## Learning

- How to build a scalable [design system](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-101-what-is-a-design-system/).
  I'm fairly new to this thing and I want to do a
  really good job setting it up and make this project a success.
- To write more. I want to improve my writing and cultivate a habit of jotting
  down notes and interesting observations. That'll go on my blog on this website.
- Nest.js a great backend framework with solid dependency injection mechanism, if you're familiar with Angular,
  you'd find it much familiar to work with!.

{/* ## Writing
