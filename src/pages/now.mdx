# Now

These are all the things I am currently involved in spanning a few days in the
past, and the foreseeable future.

## Working

As a Frontend Engineer on,
- [Almada](https://alm-live.kwalee.com/),
  an [ad mediation solution](https://www.is.com/glossary/ad-mediation/) for
  game studios, ad networks and businesses. It is a [React](https://react.dev/) project
  that Kwalee game developers to integrate their games to manage & optimize multiple ad networks, fill rates and efficiency all in one place.
- <Link href="https://kwalee.com" target="_blank">kwalee.com</Link>, a Next.js + Strapi (CMS) based project powering the main website of Kwalee Ltd. It's a migration from their old Drupal based website, which is now Live.
- <Link href="https://kwalee.com" target="_blank">CrossPromotion</Link>, an internal tool to manage cross-game ad campaigns for Kwalee games.




## Building

- [`meta`](https://github.com/tanuj101/meta), an astro based project powering this website.


## Learning

- How to build a scalable [design system](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-systems-101-what-is-a-design-system/).
  I'm fairly new to this thing and I want to do a
  really good job setting it up and make this project a success.
- Learning AI automations with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) and [LM Studio]([n8n](https://n8n.io/))
- To write more. I want to improve my writing and cultivate a habit of jotting
  down notes and interesting observations. That'll go on my blog on this website.

## Writing

- [Posts](/writings) on my site! Give them a read and see if you like them!
  Also, please [let me know](/) if you do, I would appreciate the dopamine hit.
