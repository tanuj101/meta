Welcome to my personal space of the Internet. Click around and make
yourself at home. To make the most of this visit, I would recommend checking out my [interactive résumé](/resume) and [dumb work assistants](/uses).

{/* [some stuff I've written](/writings) and */}


If there's anything more you'd like to know, just ask!

## Contact

If you have a new and interesting idea that I could collaborate on, or want to
ask a question that I might be able to answer, or simply want to talk, you
should drop by and say hi!
