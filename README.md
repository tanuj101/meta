## Portfolio

Portfolio is a personal website, powered by Récivi, a new kind of résumé for
computers and humans, in that order. You can use this to quickly set up the
following:

- **Homepage:** The template sets up pages that are usually staples of personal websites
such as `/now`, `/uses`, `/colophon` and more.
- **Blog:** The template includes support for a blog or a digital garden. This makes it
ideal for someone who wants to write freely outside of a walled garden.
- **Résumé:** The template builds an interactive résumé, and also includes a pipeline to
publish a print-friendly version at `/resume.pdf`.

You can start immediately by running:

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template recivi/portfolio
# or if you prefer pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template recivi/portfolio
```

```bash
$env:PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD="true"
```
